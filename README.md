What is a Webservice?
	
	- An API (Application Programming Interface) is the means by which third parties can write code that interfaces with other code. 
	A Web Service is a type of API, one that almost always operates over HTTP 
	(though some, like SOAP, can use alternate transports, like SMTP).
	
What is a REST web service?
	- While REST stands for Representational State Transfer, 
	which is an architectural style for networked hypermedia applications, 
	it is primarily used to build Web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. 
	A service based on REST is called a RESTful service.
